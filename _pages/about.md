About me
========
I am a true science mongrel. My background is a mixture of Chemistry, Computer Science and Bioinformatics. When I'm not doing research, marking or filling in workload sheets, I spend time on things I'm either too slow or lack talent for. 


The Nobeli Lab
==============
The lab's expertise is in computational biology and cheminformatics. Current interests include regulatory RNAs, transcriptomics in health and disease, neurodivergence and the role of small molecules in Biology.
